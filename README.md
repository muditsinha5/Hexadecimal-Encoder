# Hexadecimal-Encoder
It is a Arduino based project, code written in C language. Encoder is a digital device which represents any decimal number to binary number.
This project displays binary number 1 and 0 by turning the LED ON and OFF. If LED turns on it means 1 and if LED turns OFF it represents 0.
So through this project we can easily represent any decimal number to it's binary equivalent by turning the LEDs ON and OFF with the help of code uploaded in Arduino.
This Encoder  is capable of conveting any decimal number ranging from 0 to 15 i.e.(hexadecimal numbers) to their binary equivalent.
While writing the code we have used a simple logic i.e. we have converted the decimal number entered to binary number and according to binary bit ie zero or one, the LEDs are turned ON or OFF by using the digitalWrite(arg1,arg2) function.
Refer to the code given in the file in repo. Hope it helps.
